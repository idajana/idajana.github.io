# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a Research Assistant at FZI (Forschungszentrum Informatik). I have experience in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics. My last projects involve applications of Deep Learning in Autonomous driving (Adversarial Attacks on end-to-end driving, Semantic Segmentation with Mixtures of Experts) and Generative Video Prediction (generative models). 

I am looking for new opportunities in these areas and I am mainly interested in positions in Berlin. I would love to work in a dynamic environment that challenges me not only in technical skills, but enables me to improve every day in teamwork and soft skills, as well.
