# Did you have a pleasant flight? Sentiment analysis of flight review tweets

The goal of the project was to develop a Sentiment Analysis system based on the Twitter airline review dataset. Starts with an exploratory phase of visualizing the data available. I then apply different combinations of preprocessing tasks and machine learning algorithms. These are all measured by objective measures in order to decide which is the most effective. I also provide a qualitative assessment of the model.
